#+B2006Before the Cantharan Crusades began, the Star League of Bazidan had trading outposts scattered throughout what is now Cantharan space. With enormous patience and a mastery of communication, the Bazidanese served as intermediaries between civilizations, facilitating free trade between alien species, opening their outposts to all.#+When the Order's belligerence began to disrupt the trading routes, and Elejee and Ishima broke off their diplomatic ties to Cantharis, the Bazidanese remained neutral in an effort to negotiate a peaceful end to the Order's expansion. However, the Cantharans have begun to exhaust even the legendary patience of Bazidan. #+In the Bokleo System, an opportunity presents itself to you when you learn of a brazen Cantharan attack on a Bazidanese outpost. Cantharis's new enemy could be Earth's new ally.
