Our success in the Myrmidon System has caught the Gaitori by surprise. The last thing they expected was an offensive initiated by the Ishiman Stellar Navy. Your instinctual aggressiveness served you well.Your goal in the Demeter System is to capitalize on the Gaitori's disarray by seizing one of their planet-based outposts threatening our space. This is an opportunity for you to demonstrate the ability to coordinate a space-to-surface assault.
