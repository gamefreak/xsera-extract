The Cantharan gateship has withdrawn to Earth. It has activated a jumpgate disruption device, apparently a derivative of the Audemedon device you destroyed in the Ser system. Still, we believe we can get a single ship through a small jumpstream to intercept the gateship. This will be your last chance to destroy the gateship and to bring freedom to your home world.
