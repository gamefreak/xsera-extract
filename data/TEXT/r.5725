Many ships are capable of faster-than-light speeds.To enter warp speed, press and hold down the warp key, \i_#WRP_\i. It takes a moment for the engines to engage, so keep holding the key down.You will stay in warp for as long as you hold down the key. Releasing the key returns you to normal speed.\i_[more]_\i_
