The Fansi System was once the front line Gaitori base of operations in Obish space during the Gaitori/Obish War. Today it's the last outpost of the Gaitori Isolationists--one of the few enemies of both Cantharis and Obain. It's also the last military obstacle between you and Cantharan Space.The Cantharans intend to capture the Fansi System. Your objective is to beat them to it.
