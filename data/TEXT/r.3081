#+B2006The Ishimans’ initial analysis of the rogue asteroid was correct: it was artificially created, and originated in the Cantharan system of Los Ran during the Boodan War. Further examination of the samples you retrieved reveals a sinister secret.#+The asteroid was saturated with a biomechanical virus, apparently designed to lie dormant within the asteroid until it collided with a living planet. The artificial virus, millions of tiny mechanisms, would then activate and seek out compatible life which it could infest.#+A relic of the Boodan war, the biomechanisms could have been some kind of weapon, but the method of distribution--on artificial asteroids--would have been too slow for any tactical use. Its purpose is obscure.#+This Boodan Mechanism is beyond any known races’ ability. The ramifications of its discovery this far from Cantharis are staggering. It now seems the Cantharan Crusades have more to do with hunting down and harnessing this virus than they do with obliteration of the “Unenlightened.”
