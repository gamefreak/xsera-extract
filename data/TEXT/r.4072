You must protect our base on Demeter Alpha from enemy transports. If a Gaitori transport lands on Alpha, the mission will be aborted.The base on Alpha can produce two types of ships in addition to cruisers. ^P1014^Fighters are fast, but can only travel at sublight speeds. Their only weapons are photokinetic beam cannons.
