To pick up the prisoners, you'll be escorting this sublight Obish transport. It is armed with minimal defensive lasers capable of breaking the deep space cells open. Once a cell is breached, the prisoners will escape and attempt to enter the transport.The Obish prisoners will be vulnerable to your weapons fire, since your targeting systems will not be keyed to their suits. Be careful not to catch them in crossfire. They will also be disoriented, so give them plenty of time to enter the transport.
