#+B2005\i PART 1 \i #+10016The Gaitori, ruthless mercenaries and minions of the Cantharan Order, are the first enemy you must face in your quest for Earth. The Gaitori Union, once an interstellar trading empire that linked the many disparate space-faring civilizations together, was brought to its knees by the Order, and now serves as sentry on the Cantharan frontier. #+Although disorganized and thinly dispersed along the Los-Selactos line, the Gaitori navy insulates the Order from the systems in the galactic south. To reach Earth, you must first punch a hole through this border zone.#+Under the guidance of the Ishimans, you will launch your initial strike against the Gaitori, and test your prowess in battle for the first time. You brace your crew for confrontation.
