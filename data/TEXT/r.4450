The Gaitori military has one remaining foothold near our space:  a joint power station cluster, established as a gesture of cooperation between the Obish and Gaitori governments after the war.The Cantharan-loyalist Gaitori intend to destroy Obain's half of the Hades System's power stations. Your mission is to occupy their base, destroying as many Gaitori power stations as possible, and saving as many of the Obish stations as you can.
