^P1105^This is one of two bunker stations in the Fansi system, both of which are occupied by Gaitori Isolationists. The bunker stations have powerful armament, but their defenses can be knocked out using heavy fire to reduce their shields.Use assault transports to gain control of the bunker stations--occupying the stations will generate resources for you during the mission.
