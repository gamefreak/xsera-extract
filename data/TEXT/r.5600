#+B2005One hundred and fifty years ago, you left our planet.#+Upon the detection of a remote and indecipherable signal directed at Earth, the United Nations of Sol constructed humanity’s first interstellar ship. In honor of the program which enabled man to set foot on another world for the first time, the new vessel was christened the Apollo.#+10029A voyage was plotted to the source of the alien signal, the Ishima system, dozens of lightyears away. The effects of relativity would cause only years to pass on board the Apollo, as it approached the speed of light, while decades would pass on Earth. The ship's crew would return to a home three centuries in the future.#+You spent over five years with your crew on the Apollo. On Earth, one hundred and fifty years went by.#+When at last the Apollo emerged from the pitch blackness of deep space, and starlight gave way to sunlight, you began searching for signs of the originators of the signal. Your search was brief.#+10028The alien sun was eclipsed by the sudden appearance of a colossal ship, dwarfing the Apollo. In stunned silence you watched a message appear on your viewscreen.#+\f8e“HUMANS: YOU CALL US ISHIMANS. WE ARE HAPPY. WE WARNED YOU AND YOU ESCAPED. YOU ARE VERY SLOW.#+\f8e“YOUR WORLD IS OWNED NOW BY THE ORDER FROM THE SYSTEM YOU CALL CANTHARIS. WE ARE SAD. WE DO NOT LIKE THE CANTHARAN ORDER. THEY ARE EXPANDING THEIR SPACE. THEY CAUSE DISCORD AND WAR.#+10027\f8e“WAR DECREASES DIVERSITY. WE LIKE DIVERSITY. WE PRESERVE UNDEVELOPED CULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY LIKE YOURS.#+\f8e“WE HAVE A NEW WORLD FOR YOU. IT IS FAR AWAY FROM CANTHARIS. WE WILL TAKE YOU THERE. YOU WILL LIVE THERE. RESPOND.”#+You were numbed. The Earth, on the threshold of an interstellar community, was crushed. And now you were being told to abandon it. A quick poll of your crew dictated your response:#+\fee“UNACCEPTABLE.”#+You appealed to the Ishimans' sense of justice, asking them to right this horrible wrong. They replied that Earth was too far away and too deep in Cantharan space to risk Ishiman lives.#+You tried to play on the Ishimans' fear. What would prevent the Cantharans from encroaching on Ishiman space? The Ishimans replied that they were prepared to defend themselves.#+Finally you made an appeal to their practicality. All you wanted was the means to fight back: the technology, and the transportation. The Ishimans need risk nothing, you explained, but a small amount of hardware. In return, you would deliver a crippling blow to the Cantharan Order, and maybe, just maybe, free Earth.#+The Ishimans answered:#+\f8e“NOW THAT IS AN INTERESTING IDEA.”#+Soon your crew was preparing for war. Your original mission to make contact with the source of the alien transmission was complete. Your new objective was military: liberate Earth.#+10026You rechristened your vessel Ares.
