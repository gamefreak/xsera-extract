^P1081^The astrominer has been ordered to follow you. Guide it to the asteroid and the astrominer will attempt to break it apart. The miner’s bulky appearance belies its vulnerability to weapons fire. Protect it from attack: it is not a military vessel.The astrominer is equipped with two short-range non-concussive solitoid cannons, which will gradually weaken the asteroid's structure.
