#+B2005#+10031The Earth you left over one hundred and fifty years ago is greatly changed. The people you knew are long since dead, and the place you called home no longer exists.#+But neither time nor the Cantharans could destroy what you fought to salvage: humanity. A mercy you eventually found outside of mankind.#+You will be welcomed as a hero, to be sure. The individuals will be honored, and the crew of the Ares may even become legends.#+But the greatest victories this day do not belong to men. They belong to humanity. They belong to our unending faith in our place in the universe. And now humanity, with due arrogance, will claim that place.
