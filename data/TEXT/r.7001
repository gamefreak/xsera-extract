It’s often very useful to select yourself as a target -- that way, you can order several ships to escort you wherever you go. They’ll help attack any enemies you meet.You can target yourself without using the mouse by holding down the Target key, \i_#DST_\i, for about one second, then releasing it (without hitting any other keys).Try it now (we’ve turned off mouse selection for the moment).
