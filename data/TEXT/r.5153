Therefore, we have a second surprise: to destroy the gateship, we’ll be pushing a series of large, unstable asteroids into the Sol system through small jumpstreams from the Fergason Belt. Of course, a collision with one of these unstable asteroids would annihilate your heavy cruiser, but your task is to alter the course of the asteroids so that they collide with the gateship.
