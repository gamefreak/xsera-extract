Use the computer control keys (\i_#PRV_\i and \i_#NXT_\i to select, \i_#ACT_\i to accept and \i_#CNC_\i to back up) to navigate to the \i_Build_\i menu. Although at some bases you may have a choice of ships to build, at this moon, your only choice is to build a practice drone. From the build menu press the Computer Accept Key \i_#ACT_\i to build a drone.
