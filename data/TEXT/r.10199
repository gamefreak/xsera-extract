#+B2005The Gaitori, ruthless mercenaries and minions of the Cantharan Order, are the first enemy the humans must face in their quest for Earth.  The Gaitori Union, once an interstellar trading empire that linked the many disparate space-faring civilizations together, was brought to its knees by the Order, and now serves as sentry on the Cantharan frontier. #+Although disorganized and thinly dispersed along the Los-Selactos line, the Gaitori navy insulates the Order from the other space-faring civilizations in the galactic south. To reach Earth, the humans must first punch a hole through the bases that comprise this Gaitori border zone.#+Under the guidance of the Ishimans, the humans launch their initial strike against the Gaitori, and test their prowess in battle for the first time. With almost nothing to lose, the crew of the Ares braces itself for confrontation.
