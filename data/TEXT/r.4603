^P1152^Thanks in part to the Elejeetian Minister Jommo, the Elejeetian government is loaning us one of their cruisers, which you will be piloting for this mission. It's remarkably powerful for its size: its main weapon, the Onas pulse gun, has a range comparable to our standard concussive missiles, and its Neewo beam cannon can temporarily disable a target's control systems.
