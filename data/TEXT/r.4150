Our neighbors Obain and Gaitor recently ended a twelve year war. Although they were once fast allies -- indeed, most of Obain's technological advances came from exchanges with the Gaitori -- they were brought to the brink of mutual destruction.With the Cantharan Order's attention turned toward us, the Human-Ishiman Cooperative, the Gaitori government is seeking to break its Cantharan bonds. Its first step is restoring relations with Obain.
