Now select "Command Buoy B" as the TARGET object. This is where you will tell the drone to go. While holding down the \i_#DST_\i key, either click on Command Buoy B, or point at the buoy with your ship and press the \i_#SBS_\i key (still while holding down the \i_#DST_\i key). Command Buoy B is the nearby buoy that is farther from Omisha. You may have to scale the display to see it.
