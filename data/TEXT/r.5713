Notice that, as the enemy transport apporoaches, the display automatically zooms in. When it moves away, the display automatically zooms out.The Zoom to Closest Hostile mode is the default zoom mode, and is recommended for combat.When you’re done watching the transport, go to the next page.\i_[more]_\i_
