^P1096^In addition to fighters, cruisers, and transports, our base can produce engineering pods. Send these robot ships to flak drones to gain control of them. Once an engineering pod reaches a flak drone, the drone will be configured to fire on enemy ships.The engineering pods are equipped with defensive lasers, capable of protecting them briefly from missiles and enemy ships. The pods are invisible to the flak drones' sensors, but they are still susceptible to weapons fire.
