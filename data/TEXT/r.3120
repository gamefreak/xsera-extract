Far from supernatural, this knowledge is the result of incredible investments in technology. Through a process of quantum simulation, the Salrilians’ massive Oracular Net of computers forecasts events well before they happen, anywhere in the known galaxy. The more information the Salrilians have, the more accurate the Oracles are. Thus, the Salrilians seek to learn all they can about the Universe and its denizens. What they cannot understand, they seek to contain. What they cannot contain they destroy.#+The Salrilians have a vested interest in the success of the Cantharans, a race they can influence and understand. You were warned that as you drew closer to Earth, you ran the risk of piquing the interest of the Prophets. But now, the Ishimans have unexpected information for the weary crew of the Ares.#+A string of deep space simlabs, Salrilian installations designed to probe and analyze alien intelligences, has been detected in a nearby system.#+The aliens in the simlabs are human.
