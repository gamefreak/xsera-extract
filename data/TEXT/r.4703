^P1185^Remember, to collect an asteroid sample, it must be first broken down to the smallest possible size. Also remember that we need at least ten samples before we'll pull you out.Finally, watch out for the parasitic zerbilite organisms, which are frequently found in mineral-rich asteroid belts. And make sure you or your astrominers don't collide with one of the green unstable asteroids. A collision with one of those giants is fatal.
