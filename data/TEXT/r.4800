Welcome to your first combat mission, humans. In the Charon System, the Gaitori have just established a new base near our space. A small convoy of sublight transports is shuttling in a battalion of Gaitori reinforcements, a blatantly aggressive act. Your mission in the Charon System is to intercept and destroy the five transports.
