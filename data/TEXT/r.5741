To complete this training mission, you must destroy both transports. Don’t worry -- the cloaked transport and the visible transport are near each other.Try zooming to the \f0cZoom to Hostile\r mode, and finding the red transport symbol. Then point your ship toward it, and press and hold the warp key.When you get close, release the warp key, and close in for the kill.Use the radar to find the cloaked ship.Good luck!
