^P1119^To complete the construction of the Obish destroyer during the mission, five cargo ships will be exiting through a jump gate here. All five cargo ships must make it to the orbital shipyard in order for us to complete the destroyer. We'll alert you when the cargo ships are due to drop in-system, but it'll be up to you to make sure their path is clear.
