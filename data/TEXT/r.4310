^P10057^Part of the Fansi System's value is its orbital shipyard. The Gaitori Isolationists haven't had the resources to make use of it, but there's a remnant of the Gaitori/Obish war here--a partially constructed Obish destroyer, built during Obain's brief occupation of the system near the end of the war. We will be completing the destroyer's construction for this mission.
