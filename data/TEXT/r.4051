^P10037^We're not sure what it is, but the Order somehow managed to capture this Bazidanese vessel intact. Long range scans indicate that it is fairly massive, and apparently well armed.Since Bazidan has always been very secretive about its military technologies, we are assuming that the Cantharans are as curious as we are, and that they intend to reverse engineer this ship. Your objective is to prevent them from doing so by forcing them out of the Bokleo System.
