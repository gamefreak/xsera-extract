In an effort to restore diplomatic ties with each other, Gaitori and Obain have agreed to an exchange of prisoners of war.Unfortunately, there are members of the Gaitori military who are still Cantharan loyalists. They will resist any attempt at peace with the enemies of the Order. We have been asked to attend this exchange in the hopes that we will be able to deter any interference.
