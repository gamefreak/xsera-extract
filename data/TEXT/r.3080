#+B2006\i PART 2 \i #+With the Gaitori threat behind you, you turn your eyes to the principle enemy of your race: the Cantharan Order, servants to the Prophets and Crusaders against the Unenlightened.#+10020Centuries ago, the Cantharan Order, then a stable if inflexible defender of interstellar peace, was plunged into chaos by the Boodan Civil War. Although the Order prevailed, it was greatly changed by the conflict. Soon after the Order began its crusades, with its zealous devotion to the twin gods Zom and Doz fueling its thirst for conquest. One among the dozens of “primitive” worlds to fall under Cantharan rule was Earth.#+The Cantharan frontier is a thick swatch the Cantharans cut from the formerly free trading corridor that connected the Bazidanese Star League, the Ishiman Stellar Protectorate, the Elejeetian Empire, the Gaitori Union, and Obain. Once the Order’s crusades began to make trade in this corridor a risky and unprofitable practice, the races withdrew into their separate systems, none of them prepared to challenge the might of the Cantharan military force.#+You now must face that force. With the help of the Ishimans, you prepare to make a quick, decisive strike directly into the frontier. With speed and surprise still on your side, you hope to bisect the frontier and reach into Cantharan space before the Order has time to react.
